This is basic boilerplate code to create a Sveltekit client that connects to an Express server and uses SocketIO.

If you just want to use the Sveltekit-Express-SocketIO code just go into the client directory then run ```npm install``` and ```npm run-script dev```

I believe all of the code I've used is mostly MIT License.  You will need to respect those licenses.

The code I've written is all MIT.  I don't care what you do with the code, just don't blame me
